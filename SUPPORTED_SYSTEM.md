## Original Windows Version

The information below applies to the **original Windows version** of Notepad++. For Windows support, please refer to the [original repository](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus).

## Supported OS Table

* The column **OS** is the list of different MS Windows generations.
* The column **last version can be run** is for the status of the latest release to be run under the OS. If the current (latest) version can be run under the specific OS, then the `current version`  will be indicated instead of version number.
* The column **supported** contains the status of Notepad++ team supporting Notepad++ under the specific OS. It means if a bug is present under an OS no more supported but not under supported OS, then this issue won't be treated by the team.
